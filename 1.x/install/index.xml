      <description>Install You can install either:
 through ce-provision  manually by running a local playbook with Docker (soon)  Install manually Dependencies The stack has been created on Debian Buster. It might run on other Debian versions or derivatives, but this is untested. The main prerequesites are obviously Ansible and git. Depending on how you setup your inventory, you might need some other Python libraries (eg Boto3 for AWS). You will also need a local user to install locally, by convention we&amp;rsquo;ll name it &amp;ldquo;provision&amp;rdquo;, but you can easily override that.</description>
